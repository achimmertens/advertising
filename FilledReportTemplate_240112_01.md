# Status Of This "decentral advertising" Project

Oh, I had an exciting week. I struggeled with Hivewatcher / spaminator. I have several account and create several reports and this is all very close to spam. But at the end I think we found a good compromise and I can go on working here on Hive. For more details see my latests [tokenstats posts](https://peakd.com/@advertisingbot2/posts?filter=stats).
