@advertisingbot2 is an account, that was made for creating automated post. It creates reports for some token statistics, but also adverising campaigns. It checks the results and the work of the members and pays them their reward. It is an account from @achimmertens. 


# The Reward

The first 10 Hive users, that do this, will get 2.000 Hive each short after the end of the campaign.


# Does it work?
Yes. We did it before. Here is the proof:

# Inviting Former Members
Hi @barbyjr, @luisfe, @azabache2021, @sayury, @lunafrances, @elioe, @orlandobello, @detlev, @oasiskp2, @advertisingbot, @achimmertens,
what do you think? Do you want to join the campaign again?

# Status of this project

Last week I managed to work good on the automation of my advertising process. At the moment I still have some manual work, but it gets less. I have build in some new features, like a list of the members of the last campaigns, which help me to stay in contact for new offers. So, stay tuned, I have not finished yet, the work goes on ;-)
