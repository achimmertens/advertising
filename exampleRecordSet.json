This week's theme proposed by the recent spotlight artist @chidistickz who proposed that the participating songs revolve around \"Jesus\" caught my attention. \"Just and necessary\" theme in this time in which we approach the date selected to commemorate and celebrate the birth of our Lord Jesus Christ, or Jesus the Christ.\n\nSometimes we hear discourses about the \"historical Jesus\" and the \"Christ of faith\", but, without falling into polemics over differences of creed, it cannot be denied that his birth \"divided history in two\", which makes it still atheists must speak of times \"Before Christ\" or \"After Christ.\" The book that tells his story from his birth to his death and goes further by also recounting his resurrection and his promise to return in glory is the Bible, the best-selling, most translated and most read book in the world! The Bible was also the first printed book since when Gutenberg invented the printing press, having to decide which book to print first, he chose the Bible.\n\nIt is the Bible that tells us about Jesus and not only from his birth but also presents us with all the prophecies that predicted him. The greatest man in history, the God made man who has changed so many stories. Jesus means \"Savior\", and He currently continues saving, transforming lives, changing ways of being, ways of doing and thinking. I wrote a Christmas song in the rhythm of \"Aguinaldo de parranda\" that I perform in harmony with the Venezuelan Cuatro. The parranda bonus is worked in 2/4 rhythm with a meter of a triplet of eighth notes and two eighth notes. This rhythm is played on the cuatro with five strums: low - up-down - up - bass.\n\n\nThis song is set at the time of Jesus' birth. A little boy, the son of a shepherd, hears about the newborn Child, about the poverty of his parents and tries to convince his parents to provide him with something to bring a gift to the newborn. While he insists on his request, at first vague and at the end very specific: a little lamb, in that interval of time, the wise men arrive, the shepherds approach and the song continues repeating as a tender refrain that the child \"is called Jesus.\"\n\n\nI hope you like this song and I hope you can celebrate Christmas as a family, that we have health, peace, joy. And for those who are far or very far from their relatives, perhaps in different countries, may God allow this coming year the distances to disappear and the Christmas of distance to become the Christmas of reunion.\n\n<center><b>LYRICS</b>\n<br>\nCHORUS 1\n<br>\nDad, I want to bring a gift\nwhere that light shines\nThey say a Child has been born\na little boy\nwho has the face of an angel\nlittle angel\nand they call it Jesus.\n<br>\n1\nThe girl on the hill\nbrought it little flowers\nThe one who lives higher up,\na <i>tapara</i> with goal milk\nand the next door neighbor\ndiapers that have been embroidered\nthere goes my cousin Rita\nwho has sewn it a blanket.\nBringing something to it makes me excited\nMaybe I can sing it a song.\n<br>\n\n2\nThe boy by the river\nHe told me that the baby  is cold\nthe one who lives by the bridge\nthat its teeth haven't come out yet\nand that its parents are very very poor\nbut their peace and union are noticeable\n<br>\n3\nWhat gentlemen are those?\nthat come on camels?\nAnd although the area is very poor\nIt is seen that they have crowns.\nMany shepherds have also arrived\nin a hurry at full speed.\n\nCb>ORUS 2\n<br>\nDad, I want to bring a gift\n\n\n\n\nwhere that light shines\nThey say a Child has been born\na little boy\nwho has the face of an angel\nlittle angel\nand they call it Jesus.\n\nDad, I want to carry a little lamb\nwhere that light shines\nThey say a Child has been born\na little boy\nwho has the face of an angel\nlittle angel\n////and they call it Jesus.//// . </center><br>\n\n\n<br>\n<center>♩🎶🎵🎤♩https://images.ecency.com/DQmV7WLUhQumBxh1FWRT43Ab2EqksnGiUwC49RW2hTrHYDJ/a_separador_sayury.png♩🎶🎵🎤</center>\n<br>\n<br> <center>**Versión en castellano**</center>\n<br>\n\n<center>![](https://images.ecency.com/DQmZiPePKjumrWfYidX1aoiziUbWzC6TYjD1SuB7gU7koFS/inshot_20231218_144738311.jpg)</center>\n<br>\n\n<center><b>Esta es una publicación biling&e. Al final del post se encuentra la versión en castellano.</b></center>\nHola, comunidad de amantes, intérpretes y creadores de m7sics. Me llamó mucho ka atenci9n la temática de esta semana propuesta por el reciente artista destacado @ quien propone que las canciones participantes giren en torno a \"Jesús\".\n\nTema \"justo y necesario\" en esta época en la cual nos acercamos a la fecha seleccionada para conmemorar y celebrar el nacimiento de nuestro señor Jesucristo, o Jesús El Cristo.  \n\nA veces escuchamos disertaciones acerca del \"Jesús hist9rico\" y el \"Cristo de la fe\", pero, sin caer en polémicas de diferencias de credos, no se puede negar que su nacimiento \"dividió la historia en dos\", lo cual hace que aún los ateos deban hablar de tiempos \"Antes de Cristo\" o \"Después de Cristo\".\n\nEl libro que cuenta su historia desde su nacimiento hasta su muerte y va más allá al relatar también su resurrección y su promesa de regresar en gloria es la Biblia, el libro más vendido, más traducido y más leído del mundo!\n\nLa Biblia fue también el primer libro impreso ya que cuando Gutemberg inventó la imprenta, al tener qué decidir qué libro imprimir de primero, eligió la Biblia.\n\nEs la Biblia la que nos habla de Jesús y no sólo desde su nacimiento sino que también nos presenta todas las profecías que vaticinaron el mismo.\n\nEl hombre más grande de la historia, el Dios hecho hombre que ha cambiado tantas historias.\n\nJesús significa \"Salvador\", y Él actualmente sigue salvando, transformando vidas, cambiando maneras de ser, maneras de hacer y de pensar.\n\nEscribí una canción navideña en ritmo \"Aguinaldo de parranda\" que interpreto acomoañándome con el Cuatro Venezolano. El aguinaldo de parranda se trabaja en ritmo 2/4 con una métrica de un tresillo de corcheas y dos corcheas. Esta rítmica se toca en el cuatro con cinco rasguidos: baja - sube-baja -sube - bajs.\n\nEsta canción se ubica en el tiempo del nacimiento de Jesús. Un pequeño, hijo de un pastor, oye hablar acerca del Niño recién nacido, acerca de la pobreza de sus padres y trata de convencer al suyo de que le provea de algo para llevar un regalito al recién nacido.\n\nMientras insiste en su solicitud, al principio imprecisa y al final muy concreta: un corderito, en ese intervalo de tiempo , llegan los magos, se acercan los pastores y la canción continúa repitiendo como tierno estribillo que al niño \"lo llaman Jesús\".\n\nEspero que les guste este canto y deseo que puedan celebrar la Navidad en familia, que tengamos salud, paz, alegría. Y para quienes se encuentran lejos o muy lejos de sus parientes, quizá en países diferentes, que Dios permita que este año que viene  las distancias desaparezcan y la Navidad de lejanía se convierta en la Navidad del reencuentro.\n\n\n\n\n<BR><CENTER>\nhttps://images.ecency.com/DQmWrBbcnvd4KfSCuWjwz489G7XJtRD61PGqT4VniNhSTB3/ovejas.jpg\n<CENTER><BR>\n\n<center><b>LETRA</b>\n<br>\nCORO
