I am very aware that in this event they allow a cappella singing since I do not play an instrument and my musician friends live too far away to be able to accompany me. \n\nI'll tell you a little about myself: I am a poet, I also write fiction, mainly children's stories. I am a composer and author. I am also a manager and at this moment the artist I represent is [Junior Calle One](https://m.youtube.com/@juniorcalleone2598). I am going to participate in this first week with an original song titled \"Mi Canto a la Vida\".

Soy compositora y autora. También soy manager y en estos momentos el artista a quien  represento es a [Junior Calle One](https://m.youtube.com/@juniorcalleone2598).\n\nVoy a participar en esta primera semana con una canción original titulada \"Mi Canto a la Vida\".
