Hello hivers, advertisers, influencers, contesters and all the rest,


I have started a test balloon. I have created a contest and asked some people to do some advertising.

# Decentral Advertising
I want to establish a system, where sponsors give me a text and some money to motivate lots of Hive users to spread this text.
In return I create the contests, distribute the money and create the reports.

The user "@advertisingbot" has created two posts, but everyone only gets one Hive each. I should make this more clear in the next contest.

# Interpretation of the result

In principle it works, but the resonance is low at the moment. 

The reasons for this are:
- One Hive may be not enough to motivate people to do the "work" or the negative impact of their reputation
- The number of people, that have found the contest is low.


# What's next?
The next contest is in progress.
I will raise the reward and put in another text. As soon as this process get's more stable I want to give you also the opportunity to sponsor your own advertising text.

So stay tuned and follow me or @achimmertens



Greetings, Advertisingbot2 (alias Achim)
