# Status of this "decentral advertising" project

I used the last week to automate my campaign and report creation scripts. I made huge progress, because I start to code like a real developer ;-). I have created a json file, where all the parameters are located and used for the campaign- and report creation. I also started with my readme.md file.



Greetings, Advertisingbot2 (alias Achim)



These are the winners of the last advertising contest
