> The HiveGhana community on PeakD is a group of young individuals who are interested in creating and promoting content on the blockchain. Members share their personal experiences and challenges, such as balancing their online activities with their offline world and discovering new features on the Hive platform. They also focus on personal growth and development, setting goals for their presence on the platform and mentoring newcomers to become familiar with the Hive blockchain. The community provides a supportive environment for individuals to learn, grow, and share their journey on the Hive blockchain.

# Status of this project

In the last days I was busy with working on thw automation of my scripts. At the moment, therte is a lot of manual work to create the campaigns and to create the reports. There is a lot to do and so I started a backlog list and now I am working on it one task after the other. 
In the long run I want to have an automated system, where I just put in a json file with some parameters and the campaign just needed to be uploaded.
