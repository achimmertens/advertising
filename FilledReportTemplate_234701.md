# Status of this "decentral advertising" project


Last week I worked on the templates for the campaing and the report. I created the images with https://www.canva.com, GIMP and photofunia.com. Photofunia made all the images, where the Hive Logo is advertised. The pretty woman was created with the Bing AI image creator from Microsoft.

I still have some code to write to make the project more automated.
And of course, there are too few advertisers. I hope to find more people, which work for us.



Greetings, Advertisingbot2 (alias Achim)
