# Status of this project

This week I worked on the automatic creation of a campaing, based on a template. I only need to change the following parameters: 
```
const budget = 20 // Hive
const reward = 2 // Hive per participant
const maxAdvertisers = budget/reward
const advertisingText = 'follow @fjworld and visit https://epaytraffic.com/'
const sponsor = '@achimmertens';
```

And then the campaign-Text will be created automatically.
