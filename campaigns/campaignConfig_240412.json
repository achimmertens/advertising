  "lastWeekReport": "Last week I went into a new territory, I tried to understand the system of the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP). This is a blockchain and maybe a competitor to Hive. It looks very interesting, but as far as I can see, there is a lot of tools in the very beginning. Their communities in their social media tools are far behind the level, that we have reached here. But I think, there can be something, we can learn from.",
