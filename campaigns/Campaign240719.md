@hive.helps is a initiative, that collects money and saves it for more interests and for supporting charity projects. Everything is transparant and one can see where the donations go.

# Status of this project

This week I worked on training th AI to understand what charity text is and what not. At the moment, my bot can read some posts and check them with AI, but the results are not the quality I want them to have. But I am optimistic to bring it running.
