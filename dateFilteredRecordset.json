I was the umpire all through this simple tournament. I managed to umpire all that tennis matches that transpired in the event in a fair and satisfying manner. I will go into details of the earlier matches of the event but I will focus on the final day matches. \n\nThe finals had 2 categories of matches to be played. One category - group B  had Arnold vs George who are the most improved players. I personally coach Arnold and he managed to win against George on scores 6/3 6/3. It was a very interesting match and those who watched it can attest to it. \n\nThe second category - Group A  match was for the seniors and the participants were Pius and Barham. Pius won against Barham on scores 7/5 6/3. The event was eventually wound up with the prize giving ceremony where both the winners and runner-ups were given trophies. The semi-finalists were given medals. \n\nHowever did you that you can earn some hive through writing an advertising post.
