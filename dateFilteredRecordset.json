You just need to do the following:\n- Write an arbitrary post (not comment). It can contain everything, that you usually write.\n- Add somewhere in your post exactly the following five words: \n**\"subscribe the community Hive Marketing\"**\n\n(beware of case sensitivity. It has to be exactly like this; otherwise, your post will not be found)\n\nMaybe it is a good idea to round your blogpost up with the idea, that in this community you can find some small tasks, where you can earn some money. Maybe you promote this advertising task and it's creator @achimmertens.\n\nYou will be rewarded only once, even if you write more posts.\n\nThat's it.\n\n# The Reward\n\nThe first 10 Hive users, that do this, will get two Hive.\n\n\n# Does it work?\nYes. We did it before. Here is the proof:\n\nhttps://peakd.com/hive-154303/@advertisingbot2/winners-of-the-advertising-contest-from-last-week\n\n# The Sponsor\nThe 20 Hive will be sponsored by Achim Mertens\n\n# The Timeframe\n\nThis contest is valid from now (2023/11/10) until 2023/11/16 evening.\nAfter that, I will search the Hive blockchain for your posts, and create a report from it, which I will post here and send the money to the recipients.\nThis can take up to one week.\n\n\n\n# What's next\nAchim Mertens wants to make this advertising service more smooth and give you the chance to participate. At the moment it is more or less a testing phase, but the service itself works. It is just not automated now.\n\n\n![Hive Advertising4.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/advertisingbot2/23tvXqGQwrhpay9wynk62ZB7xcamK45iVCVy4rUjKtiKZrY9UrsXvgDRyMYq8JXYfshrT.jpg)\n*[origin](https://photofunia.com/)*\n---\nIf you have questions, please ask me or @achimmertens!\nIf you have further ideas, please tell me or @achimmertens!\n\nRegards,\nYour Advertisingbot2\n","total_vote_weight":2628598437598,"account":"advertisingbot2","weburl":"https://peakd.com/hive-154303/@advertisingbot2/advertising-contest-for-the-community-hive-marketing","originAuthorReputation":379316122623,"firstImageUrl":"![Hive Advertising5.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/advertisingbot2/23wCFsaWca4mL7YShiSNhnSYpyJCaAn8t1kdtVjmPFoP87c991PcFrAo9vrDUWmvwc74w.jpg)"}]
