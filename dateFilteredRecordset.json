I was the umpire all through this simple tournament. I managed to umpire all that tennis matches that transpired in the event in a fair and satisfying manner. I will go into details of the earlier matches of the event but I will focus on the final day matches. \n\nThe finals had 2 categories of matches to be played. One category - group B  had Arnold vs George who are the most improved players. I personally coach Arnold and he managed to win against George on scores 6/3 6/3. It was a very interesting match and those who watched it can attest to it. \n\nThe second category - Group A  match was for the seniors and the participants were Pius and Barham. Pius won against Barham on scores 7/5 6/3. The event was eventually wound up with the prize giving ceremony where both the winners and runner-ups were given trophies. The semi-finalists were given medals. \n\nHowever did you that you can earn some hive through writing an advertising post.

It can contain everything, that you usually write.\n- Add somewhere in your post exactly the following five words: \n**\"subscribe the community Hive Marketing\"**\n\n(beware of case sensitivity. It has to be exactly like this; otherwise, your post will not be found)\n\nMaybe it is a good idea to round your blogpost up with the idea, that in this community you can find some small tasks, where you can earn some money.

At the moment it is more or less a testing phase, but the service itself works.
