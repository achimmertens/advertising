I like the idea and I am all for sharing earning opportunities.\n\nBy adding the Key phrase, **subscribe the community Hive Marketing** into this blog, I expect to boost some exposer for our PEPT community and I also hope to be able to give away some #ePay tokens.\n\n**PEPT Community**\nhttps://peakd.com/c/hive-102963/\n\n**Hive Marketing Community**\nhttps://peakd.com/c/hive-154303/\n\nIf you click on my ePayTraffic banner, you will be sent to Project ePayTraffic website where you can join and earn just for viewing some member advertised sites.\n\n**Reply to this blog with your ePayTraffic username** and our #PEPT Banker Account will send you 1,000 #ePay tokens. This is a special opportunity because you do not have to hold a minimum of one(1) #PEPTide token to receive 1,000 ePay tokens. **If you are an ePayTraffic member and you hold a minimum of one(1) PEPTide you will receive 2,000 ePay tokens.**\n\nSo let us see what kind of activity this test generates and then we will enhance the rewards accordingly for the next Advertising Contest via https://peakd.com/hive-154303/@achimmertens/reminder-to-my-advertising-contest\n\n\n\n\n\n","total_vote_weight":1416570871876,"account":"fjworld","weburl":"https://peakd.com/hive-154303/@fjworld/peptevent-offers-micro-earning-opportunities-and-more","originAuthorReputation":4210349963160,"firstImageUrl":null},{"author":"achimmertens","root_title":"Reminder To My Advertising Contest","last_update":"2023-11-14T06:55:24.000Z","url":"/hive-154303/@achimmertens/reminder-to-my-advertising-contest","body":"Hi friends,\n\nI have started a contest for doing some advertising.\n\n\n![Hive Advertising.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/achimmertens/Eo8SLRm4dZTgbfLMeFbdeAZfokhRzUtjVua3BUmmmb5XGKEysFj7tfQqZgHzsN8jQSs.jpg)\n\nMaybe you have seen it:\nhttps://peakd.com/hive-154303/@advertisingbot2/advertising-contest-for-the-community-hive-marketing\n\nYou can earn 2 Hive just by writing into one of your posts:\n\n> subscribe the community Hive Marketing\n\nAt the moment, nobody (except me) reacted. So I am writing this post, to remember the contest, which ends next Thursday, and to tell you, that the money of 20 Hive is still available in the reward pool.\n\n# What is this about and why should you contribute?\nYes, it is a test. I want to see if it is possible to create a decentral advertising system. I have written some code to find the advertising text in the Hive Blockchain and want to automate the process.\nYou can see the result from last week [here](https://peakd.com/hive-154303/@advertisingbot2/winners-of-the-advertising-contest-from-last-week). \n\nI also want, the community \"Hive Marketing\" to get reanimated. That people are motivated to create some micro tasks and also ask for them. There are a lot of users here, who want to earn some small money. Let us give them a chance to do it.\n\nSo just try it out for yourself to see, that it works (and to earn 2 Hive) and stay tuned to get more information.\n\nRegards, Achim\n\n","total_vote_weight":4656165819924,"account":"achimmertens","weburl":"https://peakd.com/hive-154303/@achimmertens/reminder-to-my-advertising-contest","originAuthorReputation":71654592041375,"firstImageUrl":"![Hive Advertising.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/achimmertens/Eo8SLRm4dZTgbfLMeFbdeAZfokhRzUtjVua3BUmmmb5XGKEysFj7tfQqZgHzsN8jQSs.jpg)"},{"author":"advertisingbot","root_title":"Earn money with microtasks","last_update":"2023-11-11T14:07:27.000Z","url":"/hive-167922/@advertisingbot/earn-money-with-microtasks","body":"Hi everyone,\n\nDid you know that we have a community, where we can find some microtasks?\nHive Marketing is such a community.\nThere I fund a small Task, where I can earn 2 Hive by writing:\nsubscribe the community Hive Marketing\n\nMaybe you do the same :-)\n\nYour Advertisingbot\n\nPosted Using [InLeo Alpha](https://inleo.io/@advertisingbot/earn-money-with-microtasks)","total_vote_weight":0,"account":"advertisingbot","weburl":"https://peakd.com/hive-167922/@advertisingbot/earn-money-with-microtasks","originAuthorReputation":39244712056,"firstImageUrl":null},{"author":"advertisingbot2","root_title":"Advertising Contest for the community Hive Marketing","last_update":"2023-11-10T22:25:39.000Z","url":"/hive-154303/@advertisingbot2/advertising-contest-for-the-community-hive-marketing","body":"Hello everyone who wants to earn some small money,\n\nhere I announce the next advertising contest for week 45 from @achimmertens.\n\n\n![Hive Advertising5.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/advertisingbot2/23wCFsaWca4mL7YShiSNhnSYpyJCaAn8t1kdtVjmPFoP87c991PcFrAo9vrDUWmvwc74w.jpg)\n*[origin](https://photofunia.com/)*\n\n# The Task\nHere you have the ability to earn some Hive. You just need to do the following:\n- Write an arbitrary post (not comment). It can contain everything, that you usually write.\n- Add somewhere in your post exactly the following five words: \n**\"subscribe the community Hive Marketing\"**\n\n(beware of case sensitivity. It has to be exactly like this; otherwise, your post will not be found)\n\nMaybe it is a good idea to round your blogpost up with the idea, that in this community you can find some small tasks, where you can earn some money. Maybe you promote this advertising task and it's creator @achimmertens.\n\nYou will be rewarded only once, even if you write more posts.\n\nThat's it.\n\n# The Reward\n\nThe first 10 Hive users, that do this, will get two Hive.\n\n\n# Does it work?\nYes. We did it before. Here is the proof:\n\nhttps://peakd.com/hive-154303/@advertisingbot2/winners-of-the-advertising-contest-from-last-week\n\n# The Sponsor\nThe 20 Hive will be sponsored by Achim Mertens\n\n# The Timeframe\n\nThis contest is valid from now (2023/11/10) until 2023/11/16 evening.\nAfter that, I will search the Hive blockchain for your posts, and create a report from it, which I will post here and send the money to the recipients.\nThis can take up to one week.\n\n\n\n# What's next\nAchim Mertens wants to make this advertising service more smooth and give you the chance to participate. At the moment it is more or less a testing phase, but the service itself works. It is just not automated now.\n\n\n![Hive Advertising4.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/advertisingbot2/23tvXqGQwrhpay9wynk62ZB7xcamK45iVCVy4rUjKtiKZrY9UrsXvgDRyMYq8JXYfshrT.jpg)\n*[origin](https://photofunia.com/)*\n---\nIf you have questions, please ask me or @achimmertens!\nIf you have further ideas, please tell me or @achimmertens!\n\nRegards,\nYour Advertisingbot2\n","total_vote_weight":2629534955541,"account":"advertisingbot2","weburl":"https://peakd.com/hive-154303/@advertisingbot2/advertising-contest-for-the-community-hive-marketing","originAuthorReputation":379433187365,"firstImageUrl":"![Hive Advertising5.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/advertisingbot2/23wCFsaWca4mL7YShiSNhnSYpyJCaAn8t1kdtVjmPFoP87c991PcFrAo9vrDUWmvwc74w.jpg)"}]
